# DP-050-Migrating-SQL-Workloads-to-Azure

During this course, the students will first explore the preparation steps that are required to help with a successful data modernization project, and the tools that can help support them in the various stages of such a project. They will then explore the different methods of migrating SQL workloads to a range of different SQL services that run in Azure.

The following is a summary of the lab objectives for each module:

## Lab 1 - Introducing data platform modernization

The students will use the information gained in this module to demonstrate an understanding of data platform modernization, and why and how organizations should undertake a modernization project at a high level. They will demonstrate how to determine the cost of moving to Azure. They will also gather information about the environment that they are working on. Students will finally determine a data platform modernization strategy that should be used for a given scenario.

## Lab 2 - Choosing the right tools for data migrations

The students will use two tools in the prescribed data platform modernization stages to perform a discovery of the environment in an automated way. They will also identify any premigration compatibility issues and define a plan on how to address those issues before performing a migration of an on-premises server. Finally, they will assess how a workload will perform on a target version of Azure SQL Database.

## Lab 3 - Migrate SQL workloads to Azure virtual machines

The students will configure the environments for a data migration, including the provisioning of a SQL Server virtual machine (VM) on Azure. They will then perform a data migration to a SQL Server instance that runs on an Azure VM by transferring databases from a SQL Server 2008 R2 environment using Data Migration Assistant (DMA).

## Lab 4 - Migrate SQL workloads to Azure SQL Database

The students will perform an offline migration using the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) from an on-premises SQL Server to Azure SQL Database. Prior to this, the student will determine the right SQL Server instance option in Azure to migrate to. They will finalize the migration by using a migration tool to load and move data into the Azure SQL Database.

## Lab 5 - Migrate SQL workloads to SQL Database Managed Instance

There is no lab for this module.
